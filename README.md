Bachelor thesis objective is to create a management tool setups used in Safety <br />
Management. The application will be created as a database system in accordance with <br />
the ANSI standard. The application will be used for filling and menagement of each dial <br />
individually. The part of the application will be import of existing data. <br />

The application is created as a JavaSE application using java Swing for user-interface <br />
and Hibernate for communication with MySQL database. Because of very specific terms <br />
of Safety Management me and my supervisor consider writing code in native language. <br />
he terms like "Typova pozícia, Spôsobilosť, Úroveň spôsobilosti, Požadovaná spôsobilosť, <br />
Fyzická osoba.." will be very problematic to correctly understand in translated version. <br />

The main work in this project was communicating with customers of Safety Management. <br />
They need us to create this system from scratch and their absence of IT knowledge <br />
lead to almost to 3 months of meetings and discussions of requirements for their system. <br />

IDE: NetBeans 8.1 <br />
Java: 1.8
